            A "known HTTP string" can be an HTTP method name defined in the HTTP/1.1 RFC or an HTTP version (HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1).
            Since all of those fit in at most 8 bytes, they can be optimally looked up by reading those bytes as a long. Once
            in that format, uninteresting bits are cleared and the remaining long modulo 37 is looked up in a table.
            The number 37 was chosen because that number allows for a perfect hash of the set of
            "known strings" (CONNECT, DELETE, GET, HEAD, PATCH, POST, PUT, OPTIONS, TRACE, HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1, where strings
            with less than 8 characters have 0s appended to their ends to fill for the missing bytes).
